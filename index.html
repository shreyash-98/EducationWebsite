                At the same time, India is still a developing country of massive scale and home to the largest number of
                poor people in the world next to Nigeria. Consider that some 40 percent of India’s roads are still
                unpaved, while the country accounts for more than a quarter of all new tuberculosis infections
                worldwide—the disease kills more than 435,000 Indians each year. India also has one of the highest
                mortality rates among children under the age of five worldwide, as well as one of the worst sanitation
                systems: 524 million Indians did not use a toilet in 2017.
                According to the World Bank, India succeeded in bringing 133 million people out of poverty between 1994
                and 2012, and extreme poverty continues to decline drastically. However, India still has about a quarter
                of the world’s extreme poor, and social inequalities in the country are not only rampant but rising. If
                current trends continue, India will be in danger of disintegrating into parallel societies with economic
                realities of elites in economic centers like Mumbai or Bangalore looking exceedingly different from
                those of the impoverished masses in underdeveloped states like Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. As economists
                Amartya Sen and Jean Drèze put it in a famous quote, India is looking “more and more like islands of
                California in a sea of sub-Saharan Africa.”</p>

                Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of higher learning in India from
                possibly 8th century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern
                sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and
                there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila, in
                contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of
                education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in Ariano -páli
                Language.Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted
                practical
                education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period
                between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centres of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar)
                and Manassa in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted
                a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic, páli grammar, etc.
                Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan
                Empire.</p>

                Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan
                Empire.Sammanas and Brahmin gurus historically offered education by means of donations, rather than
                charging
                fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas, temples also became
                centres of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught.
                Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related
                to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. The priest class, the Sammanas, were imparted
                knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the Kshatriya,
                were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the Vaishya, were taught their trade
                and the working class of the Shudras was generally deprived of educational advantages.</p>
